# Taxi_Route-Optimization-using-Reinforcement-Learning
This project simulates a taxi moving in a city grid, picking up a passenger and dropping them at their destination while accounting for traffic delays. It allows users to customize the taxi start, passenger pickup, drop-off, and traffic positions, providing a visual route map and total travel time.
